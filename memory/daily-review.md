# Daily Review

Post-close trade review for USTradeBot. **One dated entry per trading day**, written
by the `ustradebot-daily-review` routine (21:10 UTC, Mon–Fri) after the US close.
Every trade taken today is reviewed: why it won or lost, and what concrete change
would improve the win rate. This file is the evidence base the improvement work and
the next morning's pre-market research build on.

Entry template:

## YYYY-MM-DD — Daily Review

### Stats
(trades, wins/losses, net P&L $, win rate, avg win vs avg loss, profit factor,
account equity; "no trades today" + why is a valid entry)

### Trade-by-trade review
(per trade: symbol, model, entry/exit time & price, confidence + sub-scores,
exit reason (stop/target/flatten), P&L, and the root cause — signal quality,
market regime, stop placement, slippage, exit logic)

### What worked / what didn't
(patterns across today's trades)

### Lessons & improvement candidates
(ranked by expected impact; feeds the improvement phase)

### Notes for pre-market research
(watchlist-level observations: symbols that chopped, gapped, or never signaled —
the pre-market routine reads this section the next morning)
