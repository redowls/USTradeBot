# Research Log

Pre-market watchlist research journal for USTradeBot. **One dated entry per day**,
written by the `ustradebot-premarket` routine (11:30 UTC, Mon–Fri) after reviewing
news + technical charts for every watchlist symbol and applying changes to
`dbo.watchlist` in the USBot database.

Hard rules the routine must never break:
- NEVER park/remove a symbol that has an open position in the Alpaca account.
- Max **30 enabled** symbols.
- Every added symbol must be verified tradable & active on Alpaca (`/v2/assets/{SYM}`).
- Park with `enabled = 0` (keep the row) instead of DELETE.

## 2026-06-13 — Pre-market Research

First run of this routine. Note: today is Saturday; next session is **Monday 2026-06-15**
(this entry prepares Monday's open).

### Market context
- Volatile Iran-headline week: big drops Jun 9–10 on strike fears, +1.75–3% rally Jun 11
  on de-escalation hopes, mixed/choppy Friday Jun 12 (S&P flat, Dow +0.6%, Nasdaq −0.3%).
- SpaceX (SPCX) IPO debuted Fri +19% to $160.95 — largest IPO ever ($75B), now ~$2.1T cap.
  Watching as a future candidate once it has trading history; too new for the ribbon now.
- Week ahead: light earnings (ACN/KR Thu, KMX Wed — none on our list). Macro-heavy:
  industrial production Mon, **FOMC decision Wed Jun 17**, retail sales Wed,
  **market closed Fri Jun 19 (Juneteenth)**. Oil fell Friday on peace-deal prospect —
  energy momentum fading.

### Carried from daily review
None — memory/daily-review.md is template-only (routines went live today).

### Watchlist review
Account: ACTIVE, equity $9,416.79, **no open positions** (no locked symbols).
26 enabled symbols reviewed against 60-day Alpaca bars (trend vs 20/50MA, 15d ATR%,
20d avg dollar volume) + 14d closed-trade P&L from dbo.trades:
- Clean uptrends, liquid: AMD (+6/+32 vs 20/50MA), INTC (+10/+30), MU (+10/+45, best
  P&L +$83), C, JPM, UNH, TSM — core keeps.
- Broad market dip names (AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, MSFT, NVDA, QQQ, SPY, TSLA, etc.): below
  20MA from the Iran selloff but mega-liquid; kept — regime, not symbol, problem.
- **WPM**: lowest dollar volume on list (~$237M/day), −6%/−12% vs 20/50MA, zero
  signals in 14d → PARK.
- **ENPH**: 10.9% ATR (extreme whipsaw, −9% vs 20MA yet +22% vs 50MA), zero trades
  in 14d; unsuited to a ribbon-trend strategy → PARK.
- Watch (kept, on notice): NVDA 0/3 trades −$54 in 14d; AVGO −$74 (1/2) and −9% vs
  20MA with 6.5% ATR; SE third-lowest liquidity ($321M) in a downtrend.
- No watchlist name reports earnings next week; no binary events besides FOMC Wed.

### Changes applied to dbo.watchlist
- PARK WPM (enabled=0): downtrend, lowest $vol, no signals 14d.
- PARK ENPH (enabled=0): 10.9% ATR whipsaw, too choppy for ribbon, no trades.
- No adds — FOMC week, list already broad; no high-conviction candidate (SPCX too new).

### Final watchlist
24 enabled: AAPL ABNB AMD AMZN AVGO BABA C COST GOOG INTC JPM MSFT MU NFLX NVDA
QCOM QQQ SE SPY TSLA TSM UNH WMT XOM. Service restarted: yes — active, clean startup,
24-symbol subscribe confirmed in journal. (Side note for daily review: pre-restart log
shows a Jun 12 20:57 APIError "order is not open" during an exit — worth a look.)

## 2026-06-15 — Pre-market Research

### Market context
- **US–Iran ceasefire relief rally.** Deal announced late Sunday; Nasdaq-100 futures
  +1.9%, S&P +1.2%, Dow ~+1%. VIX ~16.8 (−14%). Risk-on: gold + Bitcoin up, dollar down.
- **Oil crashed** on the Strait of Hormuz reopening: WTI −5.5% to ~$80, Brent ~$83
  (3-month low). Energy is the day's laggard — direct negative for XOM.
- Week ahead unchanged: light earnings (none of ours; ACN/KR Thu), **FOMC Wed Jun 17**
  is the hawkish wildcard, **market closed Fri Jun 19 (Juneteenth)**. Short week.
- Risk-on tape favors semis/AI (most of our list) and travel/airlines on cheaper fuel.

### Carried from daily review
None — memory/daily-review.md is still template-only (no daily-review entries yet).

### Watchlist review
Account ACTIVE, equity $9,416.76, **0 open positions** (no locked symbols). 24 enabled
reviewed vs 60-day Alpaca bars (through Fri 06-12 close, pre-rally) + 14d closed-trade P&L:
- 14d P&L leaders: MU +$83, INTC +$62, QQQ +$50, JPM +$28, QCOM +$25 — core keeps.
- Clean uptrends, liquid: AMD (+6/+32 vs 20/50MA), INTC (+10/+30), MU (+10/+45), C
  (+8/+10), JPM, UNH, TSM, QQQ, SPY — keeps.
- **XOM**: oil −5% to a 3-mo low on the ceasefire; already −3.2%/−3.2% vs 20/50MA
  (sustained mild downtrend), energy momentum flagged "fading" on 06-13. Long-only ribbon
  bot gets no clean longs in a fresh oil-driven downtrend, and a knife-catch bounce is the
  bad-trade risk → **PARK**.
- **NVDA** (0/3, −$54 in 14d): poor record was the Iran-selloff regime; most liquid name
  ($1.1B IEX $vol) and today's risk-on semis rally directly favors it → KEEP (regime, not
  symbol). On notice.
- **AVGO** (−$74 worst P&L, −8.8% vs 20MA weakest trend, 6.7% ATR): on notice since 06-13,
  but parking a semi right as semis rip on a relief rally is poor timing → KEEP, on notice
  one more session.
- SE/ABNB/BABA lowest IEX liquidity but all traded fine recently; no churn.
- No watchlist name reports earnings today; only binary event this week is FOMC Wed.

### Changes applied to dbo.watchlist
- PARK XOM (enabled=0): oil −5% to 3-mo low (Iran ceasefire), broken downtrend, no longs.
- No adds — list already broad and semi/index-heavy into a risk-on tape; no high-conviction
  new name (one-day ceasefire pops in airlines/travel aren't durable trends). FOMC Wed.

### Final watchlist
23 enabled: AAPL ABNB AMD AMZN AVGO BABA C COST GOOG INTC JPM MSFT MU NFLX NVDA QCOM
QQQ SE SPY TSLA TSM UNH WMT. Service restarted: yes — active, clean startup, 23-symbol
subscribe confirmed in journal, 0 positions reconciled.

## 2026-06-16 — Pre-market Research

### Market context
- **FOMC eve.** Two-day meeting starts today; decision + projections **tomorrow Wed 06-17
  2pm ET** — Kevin Warsh's first meeting as Fed Chair. CME FedWatch prices **no cuts in 2026**;
  rates expected held but the statement language ("extent and timing of additional adjustments")
  and Warsh's tone are the binary wildcard. Futures flat-to-slightly-lower (Dow ~flat) ahead of it.
- **Monday 06-15 was a powerful risk-on rally** on the US–Iran ceasefire / Strait of Hormuz
  reopening: Nasdaq **+3.07%**, S&P **+1.65%**, Dow +0.92%. Oil fell to ~$80 (mid-April low);
  energy stays the laggard → XOM correctly parked, no missed longs.
- **No watchlist name reports earnings today** (light week; ACN/KR Thu). **Market closed Fri
  06-19 (Juneteenth)** — short, event-heavy week. AMD announced a small AI-memory acquisition
  (MEXT) — benign for a mega-liquid name, no halt risk. SPCX +8.9% pre-market but still too new
  for the ribbon. Gold/silver firm, dollar soft.

### Carried from daily review
06-15 daily-review "Notes for pre-market research" acted on:
- **XOM park looks right** (energy stayed weak on the oil drop) → keep parked.
- **GOOG over-traded** (bot stacked a 3rd low-conviction lot, −$15) — flagged as a *code/sizing*
  note, "not a watchlist change" → no action here.
- **Semis regime call paid off** (MU +$77 carried; AVGO behaved at +$5) → keep NVDA/AVGO/TSM.
- No symbol "never signaled"; list produces plenty of triggers → no park-for-inactivity.

### Watchlist review
Account ACTIVE, equity $9,384.87, **0 open positions** (no locked symbols). 23 enabled reviewed
against 14d closed-trade P&L from dbo.trades + the 06-15 risk-on/regime read:
- **14d P&L leaders:** MU +$159 (4 tr, 3W), INTC +$62, QQQ +$50, JPM +$28, QCOM +$25, ABNB +$15
  — core keeps; semis/index momentum intact.
- **Laggards:** AVGO −$69 (3 tr, 2W — losses front-loaded in the Iran selloff regime),
  NVDA −$54 (0/3), TSLA −$37, TSM −$9. NVDA/AVGO held on the explicit "regime not symbol" call
  from 06-13/06-15 — the AI/semis regime is now *working* (MU +$77 carried, AVGO +$5 on 06-15);
  parking the two most liquid semis the day before FOMC, mid-regime, would be poor timing → KEEP,
  on notice. TSLA/TSM mega-liquid, single bad trades, no trend break → keep.
- Lower-liquidity names (SE, ABNB, BABA) all traded fine recently (ABNB +$15, BABA +$7.5) → keep.
- No earnings on any name today; only binary event is FOMC tomorrow.

### Changes applied to dbo.watchlist
**No changes.** The list is broad (23), semi/index-heavy into a regime that's confirmed working,
carries zero earnings risk today, and the eve of a binary FOMC is the wrong time to churn or to
chase a momentum add. XOM/WPM/ENPH/BIRD stay parked. No high-conviction new name (SPCX too new).

### Final watchlist
23 enabled (unchanged): AAPL ABNB AMD AMZN AVGO BABA C COST GOOG INTC JPM MSFT MU NFLX NVDA QCOM
QQQ SE SPY TSLA TSM UNH WMT. Service **not restarted** (no watchlist change — bot reads the list
only at startup, so a restart would be pointless churn).
