# Research Log

Pre-market watchlist research journal for USTradeBot. **One dated entry per day**,
written by the `ustradebot-premarket` routine (11:30 UTC, Mon–Fri) after reviewing
news + technical charts for every watchlist symbol and applying changes to
`dbo.watchlist` in the USBot database.

Hard rules the routine must never break:
- NEVER park/remove a symbol that has an open position in the Alpaca account.
- Max **30 enabled** symbols.
- Every added symbol must be verified tradable & active on Alpaca (`/v2/assets/{SYM}`).
- Park with `enabled = 0` (keep the row) instead of DELETE.

## 2026-06-13 — Pre-market Research

First run of this routine. Note: today is Saturday; next session is **Monday 2026-06-15**
(this entry prepares Monday's open).

### Market context
- Volatile Iran-headline week: big drops Jun 9–10 on strike fears, +1.75–3% rally Jun 11
  on de-escalation hopes, mixed/choppy Friday Jun 12 (S&P flat, Dow +0.6%, Nasdaq −0.3%).
- SpaceX (SPCX) IPO debuted Fri +19% to $160.95 — largest IPO ever ($75B), now ~$2.1T cap.
  Watching as a future candidate once it has trading history; too new for the ribbon now.
- Week ahead: light earnings (ACN/KR Thu, KMX Wed — none on our list). Macro-heavy:
  industrial production Mon, **FOMC decision Wed Jun 17**, retail sales Wed,
  **market closed Fri Jun 19 (Juneteenth)**. Oil fell Friday on peace-deal prospect —
  energy momentum fading.

### Carried from daily review
None — memory/daily-review.md is template-only (routines went live today).

### Watchlist review
Account: ACTIVE, equity $9,416.79, **no open positions** (no locked symbols).
26 enabled symbols reviewed against 60-day Alpaca bars (trend vs 20/50MA, 15d ATR%,
20d avg dollar volume) + 14d closed-trade P&L from dbo.trades:
- Clean uptrends, liquid: AMD (+6/+32 vs 20/50MA), INTC (+10/+30), MU (+10/+45, best
  P&L +$83), C, JPM, UNH, TSM — core keeps.
- Broad market dip names (AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, MSFT, NVDA, QQQ, SPY, TSLA, etc.): below
  20MA from the Iran selloff but mega-liquid; kept — regime, not symbol, problem.
- **WPM**: lowest dollar volume on list (~$237M/day), −6%/−12% vs 20/50MA, zero
  signals in 14d → PARK.
- **ENPH**: 10.9% ATR (extreme whipsaw, −9% vs 20MA yet +22% vs 50MA), zero trades
  in 14d; unsuited to a ribbon-trend strategy → PARK.
- Watch (kept, on notice): NVDA 0/3 trades −$54 in 14d; AVGO −$74 (1/2) and −9% vs
  20MA with 6.5% ATR; SE third-lowest liquidity ($321M) in a downtrend.
- No watchlist name reports earnings next week; no binary events besides FOMC Wed.

### Changes applied to dbo.watchlist
- PARK WPM (enabled=0): downtrend, lowest $vol, no signals 14d.
- PARK ENPH (enabled=0): 10.9% ATR whipsaw, too choppy for ribbon, no trades.
- No adds — FOMC week, list already broad; no high-conviction candidate (SPCX too new).

### Final watchlist
24 enabled: AAPL ABNB AMD AMZN AVGO BABA C COST GOOG INTC JPM MSFT MU NFLX NVDA
QCOM QQQ SE SPY TSLA TSM UNH WMT XOM. Service restarted: yes — active, clean startup,
24-symbol subscribe confirmed in journal. (Side note for daily review: pre-restart log
shows a Jun 12 20:57 APIError "order is not open" during an exit — worth a look.)

## 2026-06-15 — Pre-market Research

### Market context
- **US–Iran ceasefire relief rally.** Deal announced late Sunday; Nasdaq-100 futures
  +1.9%, S&P +1.2%, Dow ~+1%. VIX ~16.8 (−14%). Risk-on: gold + Bitcoin up, dollar down.
- **Oil crashed** on the Strait of Hormuz reopening: WTI −5.5% to ~$80, Brent ~$83
  (3-month low). Energy is the day's laggard — direct negative for XOM.
- Week ahead unchanged: light earnings (none of ours; ACN/KR Thu), **FOMC Wed Jun 17**
  is the hawkish wildcard, **market closed Fri Jun 19 (Juneteenth)**. Short week.
- Risk-on tape favors semis/AI (most of our list) and travel/airlines on cheaper fuel.

### Carried from daily review
None — memory/daily-review.md is still template-only (no daily-review entries yet).

### Watchlist review
Account ACTIVE, equity $9,416.76, **0 open positions** (no locked symbols). 24 enabled
reviewed vs 60-day Alpaca bars (through Fri 06-12 close, pre-rally) + 14d closed-trade P&L:
- 14d P&L leaders: MU +$83, INTC +$62, QQQ +$50, JPM +$28, QCOM +$25 — core keeps.
- Clean uptrends, liquid: AMD (+6/+32 vs 20/50MA), INTC (+10/+30), MU (+10/+45), C
  (+8/+10), JPM, UNH, TSM, QQQ, SPY — keeps.
- **XOM**: oil −5% to a 3-mo low on the ceasefire; already −3.2%/−3.2% vs 20/50MA
  (sustained mild downtrend), energy momentum flagged "fading" on 06-13. Long-only ribbon
  bot gets no clean longs in a fresh oil-driven downtrend, and a knife-catch bounce is the
  bad-trade risk → **PARK**.
- **NVDA** (0/3, −$54 in 14d): poor record was the Iran-selloff regime; most liquid name
  ($1.1B IEX $vol) and today's risk-on semis rally directly favors it → KEEP (regime, not
  symbol). On notice.
- **AVGO** (−$74 worst P&L, −8.8% vs 20MA weakest trend, 6.7% ATR): on notice since 06-13,
  but parking a semi right as semis rip on a relief rally is poor timing → KEEP, on notice
  one more session.
- SE/ABNB/BABA lowest IEX liquidity but all traded fine recently; no churn.
- No watchlist name reports earnings today; only binary event this week is FOMC Wed.

### Changes applied to dbo.watchlist
- PARK XOM (enabled=0): oil −5% to 3-mo low (Iran ceasefire), broken downtrend, no longs.
- No adds — list already broad and semi/index-heavy into a risk-on tape; no high-conviction
  new name (one-day ceasefire pops in airlines/travel aren't durable trends). FOMC Wed.

### Final watchlist
23 enabled: AAPL ABNB AMD AMZN AVGO BABA C COST GOOG INTC JPM MSFT MU NFLX NVDA QCOM
QQQ SE SPY TSLA TSM UNH WMT. Service restarted: yes — active, clean startup, 23-symbol
subscribe confirmed in journal, 0 positions reconciled.

## 2026-06-16 — Pre-market Research

### Market context
- **FOMC eve.** Two-day meeting starts today; decision + projections **tomorrow Wed 06-17
  2pm ET** — Kevin Warsh's first meeting as Fed Chair. CME FedWatch prices **no cuts in 2026**;
  rates expected held but the statement language ("extent and timing of additional adjustments")
  and Warsh's tone are the binary wildcard. Futures flat-to-slightly-lower (Dow ~flat) ahead of it.
- **Monday 06-15 was a powerful risk-on rally** on the US–Iran ceasefire / Strait of Hormuz
  reopening: Nasdaq **+3.07%**, S&P **+1.65%**, Dow +0.92%. Oil fell to ~$80 (mid-April low);
  energy stays the laggard → XOM correctly parked, no missed longs.
- **No watchlist name reports earnings today** (light week; ACN/KR Thu). **Market closed Fri
  06-19 (Juneteenth)** — short, event-heavy week. AMD announced a small AI-memory acquisition
  (MEXT) — benign for a mega-liquid name, no halt risk. SPCX +8.9% pre-market but still too new
  for the ribbon. Gold/silver firm, dollar soft.

### Carried from daily review
06-15 daily-review "Notes for pre-market research" acted on:
- **XOM park looks right** (energy stayed weak on the oil drop) → keep parked.
- **GOOG over-traded** (bot stacked a 3rd low-conviction lot, −$15) — flagged as a *code/sizing*
  note, "not a watchlist change" → no action here.
- **Semis regime call paid off** (MU +$77 carried; AVGO behaved at +$5) → keep NVDA/AVGO/TSM.
- No symbol "never signaled"; list produces plenty of triggers → no park-for-inactivity.

### Watchlist review
Account ACTIVE, equity $9,384.87, **0 open positions** (no locked symbols). 23 enabled reviewed
against 14d closed-trade P&L from dbo.trades + the 06-15 risk-on/regime read:
- **14d P&L leaders:** MU +$159 (4 tr, 3W), INTC +$62, QQQ +$50, JPM +$28, QCOM +$25, ABNB +$15
  — core keeps; semis/index momentum intact.
- **Laggards:** AVGO −$69 (3 tr, 2W — losses front-loaded in the Iran selloff regime),
  NVDA −$54 (0/3), TSLA −$37, TSM −$9. NVDA/AVGO held on the explicit "regime not symbol" call
  from 06-13/06-15 — the AI/semis regime is now *working* (MU +$77 carried, AVGO +$5 on 06-15);
  parking the two most liquid semis the day before FOMC, mid-regime, would be poor timing → KEEP,
  on notice. TSLA/TSM mega-liquid, single bad trades, no trend break → keep.
- Lower-liquidity names (SE, ABNB, BABA) all traded fine recently (ABNB +$15, BABA +$7.5) → keep.
- No earnings on any name today; only binary event is FOMC tomorrow.

### Changes applied to dbo.watchlist
**No changes.** The list is broad (23), semi/index-heavy into a regime that's confirmed working,
carries zero earnings risk today, and the eve of a binary FOMC is the wrong time to churn or to
chase a momentum add. XOM/WPM/ENPH/BIRD stay parked. No high-conviction new name (SPCX too new).

### Final watchlist
23 enabled (unchanged): AAPL ABNB AMD AMZN AVGO BABA C COST GOOG INTC JPM MSFT MU NFLX NVDA QCOM
QQQ SE SPY TSLA TSM UNH WMT. Service **not restarted** (no watchlist change — bot reads the list
only at startup, so a restart would be pointless churn).

## 2026-06-17 — Pre-market Research

### Market context
- **FOMC decision DAY.** Statement + SEP/dot-plot at **2pm ET**, Warsh's first press conference 2:30pm.
  Hold is near-certain (CME FedWatch ~97%, range 3.50–3.75%); the binary wildcard is the **dot plot**
  (May CPI ran hot at 4.2% y/y → the single 2026 cut likely removed; ~70% odds of ≥1 *hike* by year-end),
  whether the **easing bias** is dropped, and Warsh's debut tone (regarded as hawkish). A hawkish print
  is specifically negative for high-multiple semis/AI.
- **Tape going in is split:** Tue 06-16 the **Dow closed at a record (>52,000)** while tech/Nasdaq
  slumped — value/cyclical rotation, growth on the back foot ahead of the print. Oil extended lower to
  **<$80 (WTI ~$78.7, first sub-$80 since March)** on the US–Iran ceasefire framework → energy stays the
  laggard, **XOM correctly parked**. 2-yr yield ~4.06%.
- **No watchlist name reports earnings today** (light week; ACN/KR Thu). **Market closed Fri 06-19
  (Juneteenth)** — short, event-heavy week.

### Carried from daily review
06-16 daily-review "Notes for pre-market research" acted on:
- **🔒 4 positions carried NAKED overnight** (EOD flatten failed on persistent Alpaca 504s): AAPL (7),
  ABNB (15), BABA (16), GOOG (4) — **broker-confirmed still open this morning**. Hard rule honored:
  **NOT parked**, all remain enabled. The startup reconcile will mark them MANAGING; the session will
  re-manage/flatten them (or `python -m bot.flatten --yes` once open if sooner is wanted). IMP-002
  shipped a critical Telegram page for a future failed flatten.
- **No entry-quality concerns** raised — 06-16's failure was broker-side (504s) + exit infra, not symbols.
- **BABA** the lone green open (+$12.4 at the close) — lower-liquidity but behaving; keep.

### Watchlist review
Account ACTIVE, equity **$9,347.37** (last_equity $9,392.88; the dip is the naked-overnight marks —
AAPL −$4.75, ABNB −$8.55, BABA −$15.87, GOOG −$8.32 unrealized). **4 open positions = locked.**
23 enabled reviewed vs 14d closed-trade P&L from dbo.trades (45 trades, net **+$201**):
- **14d P&L leaders:** MU +$159 (4 tr, 3W), INTC +$62, QQQ +$50 (2/2), JPM +$28, QCOM +$25, ABNB +$15,
  UNH +$9 — core keeps; semis/index momentum intact and the AI/semis regime is confirmed working.
- **Laggards:** AVGO −$69 (3 tr, 2W — one front-loaded Iran-selloff loser), NVDA −$54 (0/3), TSLA −$37,
  TSM −$9, C −$5.6, AMD −$4.9. All held on the standing **"regime not symbol"** call — the regime that
  produced those losses (Iran selloff) has reversed and is now paying (MU is the top earner). Parking
  the two most-liquid semis (NVDA/AVGO) mid-working-regime, on a binary FOMC day, is poor timing → KEEP,
  on notice. TSLA/AMD/TSM/C mega-liquid, single bad trades, no trend break → keep.
- Lower-liquidity names (SE +$2.5, ABNB +$15, BABA +$7.5) all traded fine recently → keep.
- No earnings on any name today; only binary event is FOMC at 2pm ET.

### Changes applied to dbo.watchlist
**No changes.** 4 names are locked (open positions, can't be parked); the list is broad (23) and
semi/index-heavy into a regime that's confirmed working; zero earnings risk today; and the **FOMC
decision is exactly the binary event you don't churn or chase a momentum add into** (same discipline as
06-15/06-16). XOM/WPM/ENPH/BIRD stay parked. No high-conviction new name.

### Final watchlist
23 enabled (unchanged): AAPL ABNB AMD AMZN AVGO BABA C COST GOOG INTC JPM MSFT MU NFLX NVDA QCOM
QQQ SE SPY TSLA TSM UNH WMT. Service **not restarted** (no watchlist change → restart would be pointless
churn). 🔒 Locked: AAPL ABNB BABA GOOG (open positions).

## 2026-06-18 — Pre-market Research

### Market context
- **Post-FOMC rebound, semis leading.** Wed 06-17's hawkish surprise (dot plot median to 3.8%,
  ~half the committee pencils a 2026 *hike*, Warsh's price-stability emphasis) sold stocks off
  (S&P −1.21%, Nasdaq −1.34%, worst new-chair "Fed day" since 1994). This morning futures
  **rebound**: S&P +0.9%, Nasdaq-100 **+1.6%**, Dow +0.6%. 2-yr yield ~4.22% (jumped +16bp Wed).
- **Chips rip on an Intel–Apple headline.** Trump said INTC will partner with AAPL on US chip
  design → **INTC +9% pre**, MU **+4.7%**, NVDA +1.2%, **SOXX +3.9%**. Directly favors our
  semi/AI-heavy list and AAPL — clean trending longs for the long-only ribbon if it holds.
- **No watchlist name reports earnings today.** Today's earnings are **ACN, KR** (neither ours).
  **Market closed Fri 06-19 (Juneteenth)** — today is the last session of a short, event-heavy week.

### Carried from daily review
06-17 daily-review "Notes for pre-market research" acted on:
- **No naked positions into 06-18** — broker confirmed **flat (0 positions)** this morning
  (equity $9,215.44 = last_equity, all 06-17 names exited cleanly broker-side). Nothing locked.
- **"Semis/megacap tape faded post-FOMC; watch for a fresh 5m trend before leaning in"** — noted,
  but this morning's tape has *reversed* bullishly on the INTC–AAPL news; the gate ribbon will
  confirm a real trend before any entry, so no symbol action needed.
- **"Late-day entries keep failing… Watchlist is fine; the issue is *when* we enter. Nothing to
  park for signal quality."** — explicit: no watchlist parks indicated. INTC kept (behaved well,
  trailed to a +$2.20 win). BABA/GOOG/AAPL/ABNB losses were the overnight carry, not the names.

### Watchlist review
Account ACTIVE, equity **$9,215.44**, **0 open positions** (no locked symbols). 23 enabled
reviewed vs 12d closed-trade P&L from dbo.trades (net **+$19.95**):
- **Leaders:** MU +$144 (5 tr, 3W), INTC +$64 (3 tr, 2W), QQQ +$50 (2/2), JPM +$28, QCOM +$25,
  UNH +$9, SPY +$6 — core keeps; semis/index momentum intact and *re-igniting* on today's tape.
- **Laggards:** AVGO −$69, TSLA −$57, NVDA −$54 (0/3, still never won), BABA −$36, GOOG −$33,
  TSM −$30, AAPL −$21. Every one is explained by the daily reviews as **regime (Iran selloff /
  FOMC fade) or the 06-16 naked-overnight carry — not signal quality.** All are mega-liquid (NVDA
  the most liquid name on the list) and today's semis rebound directly favors the AI/semi cohort;
  parking them into a bullish chip reversal would be exactly the bad timing prior runs warned of
  → KEEP, on notice. Single-bad-trade megacaps (TSLA/TSM/AAPL/C/AMD) show no trend break → keep.
- Lower-liquidity names (SE +$2.5, ABNB +$0.4, BABA) traded fine recently → keep.
- No earnings on any watchlist name today; FOMC (the week's binary event) is resolved.

### Changes applied to dbo.watchlist
**No changes.** The list is broad (23), carries zero earnings risk today, the binary FOMC event is
behind us, and the morning tape favors our semi/index-heavy roster (INTC–AAPL chip news). Every
laggard's losses are regime/overnight-carry per the daily reviews, none is a signal-quality or
liquidity park candidate, and no name "never signals." No high-conviction non-semi add, and we're
already heavily exposed to the leading sector — no churn for activity. XOM/WPM/ENPH/BIRD stay parked.

### Final watchlist
23 enabled (unchanged): AAPL ABNB AMD AMZN AVGO BABA C COST GOOG INTC JPM MSFT MU NFLX NVDA QCOM
QQQ SE SPY TSLA TSM UNH WMT. Service **not restarted** (no watchlist change → bot reads the list
only at startup, so a restart would be pointless churn). 🔒 Locked: none (0 open positions).

## 2026-06-19 — Pre-market Research

**Run on Juneteenth — US market CLOSED today (Fri 06-19). This entry prepares the next
session, Monday 2026-06-22.** No restart/flatten attempted (orders can't fill while closed).

### Market context
- **Short holiday-shortened week behind us; hawkish-Fed overhang into Monday.** Warsh's
  first FOMC (06-17) held 3.50–3.75% but the dot plot leaned to *hikes* (9 officials see
  potential 2026 hikes), triggering a 06-17 selloff; 06-18 rebounded (Nasdaq-100 +1.6%) on
  the INTC–AAPL chip-design headline (INTC +9%, MU +4.7%, SOXX +3.9%). Tape stabilizing on
  lower oil (WTI <$80) + yield stabilization; 2-yr ~4.22%.
- **Semis remain the market's support beam** — the AI/semi regime our list is built around is
  working. Energy still the laggard (XOM correctly parked).
- **Monday 06-22 earnings:** AREC, EBF, FRVO, ICLR, POWW — **none on our watchlist** → no
  Monday earnings risk. Macro week is light post-holiday; a key inflation reading lands midweek.
- **⚠️ MU reports earnings Wed 06-24** (the week's marquee chip catalyst). MU is an **open/locked
  position** and a watchlist name — binary event risk midweek, but **not Monday's session** and
  cannot be parked while held. Flag for Tue/Wed daily-review to manage the MU lot before the print.

### Carried from daily review
06-18 daily-review "Notes for pre-market research" acted on:
- **🔒 7 positions OPEN/NAKED into 2026-06-22** (protective legs expired over the long weekend):
  **GOOG(5) INTC(16) MU(1) QQQ(1) SE(15) TSLA(4) TSM(4)** — broker-confirmed open this morning,
  ≈ +$36 unrealized. Hard rule honored: **NOT parked**, all remain enabled. Monday's startup
  reconcile marks them MANAGING; flatten via `python -m bot.flatten --yes` once the market opens
  if a clean book is wanted sooner (NOT possible today — market closed).
- **"Entry quality was fine — no watchlist parks indicated."** All 7 fresh lots signalled and
  filled cleanly on the bullish chip-news tape; the 06-18 book is corrupted (fake exits, IMP-004
  shipped to fix) but that is exit/flatten infra, **not** symbol/signal quality → no park action.
- **Late-session weak-xo entries** (QQQ conf 64/xo 0.04, SE conf 65/xo 0.07 at 19:35 UTC) flagged
  again — a *code* fix (wider flatten window = late-entry cutoff, candidate for daily-review), **not
  a watchlist change**.

### Watchlist review
Account ACTIVE, equity **$9,248.81** (cash −$1,426.58 from the held lots, BP $22,903). **7 open
positions = locked.** 23 enabled reviewed vs 14d closed-trade P&L from dbo.trades (NB: 06-18 rows
are unreliable pending Monday's book correction, so P&L read is directional only):
- **Leaders:** INTC +$207 (5 tr, 3W), MU +$152 (6 tr, 4W), QQQ +$51 (3/3), JPM +$28, QCOM +$25 —
  core keeps; semi/index momentum intact and re-igniting on the INTC–AAPL tape.
- **Laggards:** AVGO −$69 (2/3), NVDA −$54 (0/3, still never won), TSLA −$38, BABA −$36, GOOG −$25,
  AAPL −$21. Every one is regime (Iran selloff / FOMC fade) or 06-16/06-18 overnight-carry per the
  daily reviews — **not signal quality.** All mega-liquid; parking the most-liquid semis into a
  working semi regime is the poor timing prior runs warned of → KEEP, on notice.
- Lower-liquidity names (SE, ABNB, BABA) traded fine recently → keep.
- No Monday earnings on any watchlist name; MU earnings Wed 06-24 is the only binary flag (locked).

### Changes applied to dbo.watchlist
**No changes.** 7 names are locked (open positions, can't be parked); the list is broad (23 ≤ 30),
semi/index-heavy into a confirmed-working regime, carries **zero Monday earnings risk**, and the
daily review explicitly indicates no signal-quality/liquidity parks. No high-conviction new name to
add (and we're already heavily exposed to the leading sector — no churn for activity). XOM/WPM/ENPH/
BIRD stay parked. MU earnings (Wed) is a midweek manage-the-lot task, not a today park.

### Final watchlist

## 2026-06-22 — Pre-market Research

**Verdict day** (per weekly review): the 7 naked lots carried over the Juneteenth weekend
should auto-flatten at the open via the still-live `accepted` 06-18 close orders, and IMP-004/
005/002 get their first live test. That is an **exit-infra/ops** matter — no watchlist action.

### Market context
- **Risk-off open.** US futures point **lower** on **renewed US–Iran tensions** (Trump
  threatened fresh strikes; Tehran reportedly suspended talks) → **oil higher**. First session
  back after Juneteenth (Fri 06-19 closed).
- **Backdrop:** hawkish Fed (06-17: 12-0 hold 3.50–3.75%, dot plot — 9/18 see ≥1 hike in 2026)
  + **PCE inflation report Fri 06-26** is the week's macro binary. Last week Nasdaq +2.43% led
  by semis on the **INTC–Apple chip-design** headline (INTC +10.6%, MU +8.5%, NVDA +2.8% Thu).
- **Earnings this week:** CCL & FDX Tue, **MU Wed 06-24**, PAYX & TCOM Wed. **No watchlist name
  reports today.** Only MU (Wed) is on our list — and it's a **locked held lot**.

### Carried from daily review
06-19 daily-review "Notes for pre-market research" acted on:
- **🔒 7 positions OPEN/NAKED into today:** GOOG(5) INTC(16) MU(1) QQQ(1) SE(15) TSLA(4) TSM(4)
  — broker-confirmed open this morning (equity $9,354.97 vs last_equity $9,248.81, **+$106 as
  the carried lots marked up**; net unreal ≈ +$139: INTC +$64.5, TSM +$54.1, MU +$49.6 lead,
  GOOG −$27.6 the laggard). **Hard rule honored: NOT parked, all remain enabled.** The live
  06-18 `accepted` close orders should auto-flatten them at 09:30 ET — leave them, do NOT cancel.
- **"Entry/symbol quality is NOT the issue"** — all 7 signalled/filled cleanly; the open book is
  exit-infra residue, not signal quality → **no parks indicated.**
- **⚠️ MU earnings Wed 06-24** flagged: MU is a held lot + watchlist name; binary risk **midweek,
  not today**, and cannot be parked while held → carry the flag to Tue/Wed daily-review.

### Watchlist review
Account ACTIVE, equity **$9,354.97**, cash −$1,426.58 (margin from held lots), BP $23,217.51.
**7 open positions = locked.** 23 enabled reviewed vs 14d closed-trade P&L from dbo.trades (NB:
06-18 rows still over-state P&L pending the Monday book correction → directional read only):
- **Leaders:** INTC +$207 (5 tr, 3W), MU +$152 (6 tr, 4W), QQQ +$51 (3/3), JPM +$28, QCOM +$25 —
  core keeps; semi/index momentum is the regime our list is built around.
- **Laggards:** AVGO −$69 (2/3), NVDA −$54 (0/3, still never won), TSLA −$38, BABA −$36, GOOG −$25,
  AAPL −$21. All explained by the daily reviews as **regime (Iran selloff / FOMC fade) or
  overnight-carry**, not signal quality; all mega-liquid. Parking the most-liquid semis mid-regime
  on a risk-off day is the poor timing prior runs warned of → KEEP, on notice.
- Lower-liquidity names (SE, ABNB, BABA) traded fine recently → keep.
- **XOM (parked):** renewed Iran tensions bid oil up this morning, but that's a one-headline pop,
  not a durable energy uptrend — same discipline as before, **stays parked** (no knife-catch long).
- No earnings on any watchlist name today; only binary events are MU (Wed) + PCE (Fri).

### Changes applied to dbo.watchlist
**No changes.** 7 names are locked (open positions, can't be parked); the list is broad (23 ≤ 30)
and semi/index-heavy into a confirmed-working regime; **zero earnings risk today**; and a risk-off
open on renewed Iran tensions is the wrong tape to chase a momentum add into (oil's pop is one
headline, not a trend → XOM stays parked). Daily reviews explicitly indicate no signal-quality/
liquidity parks. XOM/WPM/ENPH/BIRD stay parked. MU earnings (Wed) is a midweek manage-the-lot task.

### Final watchlist
23 enabled (unchanged): AAPL ABNB AMD AMZN AVGO BABA C COST GOOG INTC JPM MSFT MU NFLX NVDA QCOM
QQQ SE SPY TSLA TSM UNH WMT. Service **not restarted** (no watchlist change → bot reads the list

## 2026-06-24 — Pre-market Research

**MU park day.** The carried 06-19/06-22/06-23 instruction was explicit: today's pre-market
routine **MUST park MU** before the open because MU reports earnings **after today's close**
(binary event). Book is clean & flat (0 positions), so MU is **not locked** → free to park.
This is the day's one decided action.

### Market context
- **Futures mixed after a Tuesday semi rout.** Tue 06-23 saw a tech/semiconductor-driven
  selloff (S&P **−1.44%**, Nasdaq **−2.21%**) — South Korea's chip-heavy KOSPI fell ~10%, a
  BofA rate-hike note and AI/semi-valuation fears hit the sector. This morning stabilizes:
  S&P futures +0.1%, **Nasdaq-100 +0.5%**, Dow −0.2%. Memory/chips bounce pre-market (MU
  +4.1% after −13% Tue, SanDisk +3%, **INTC +1%**, **QCOM +2.2%**, DRAM ETF +4%). KOSPI
  rebounded +3% overnight.
- **⚠️ MU reports earnings after today's close** (confirmed; consensus ~$20.2–20.8 EPS on
  ~$33.5–35.7B rev). Options price a **~14–17% post-print move** on a name up 244% YTD past a
  $1T cap — a textbook binary overnight event. Given the flatten-reliability history (now fixed
  but only one clean session), **carrying MU overnight into the print is unacceptable → PARK.**
- **Other earnings today:** PAYX, JEF, LEVI — **none on our watchlist**. Macro: May new-home
  sales, Fed stress-test results. Oil eased again (**WTI ~$72**) on US–Iran diplomacy → energy
  the laggard, **XOM stays parked**. May **PCE Thu 06-25** is the week's next macro binary.

### Carried from daily review
06-23 daily-review "Notes for pre-market research" acted on:
- **Book CLEAN & FLAT into 06-24** — broker-confirmed **0 positions**, equity $9,314.69 all
  cash, 0 DB-open rows. **Nothing locked**; MU is a watchlist name only (not a held lot) → the
  hard "never park a held name" rule does **not** apply, MU is parkable.
- **"The Wed pre-market routine MUST PARK MU before Wed's open so the bot cannot hold it into
  the after-close print"** — **ACTIONED today** (the sole change this run).
- **"Entry/symbol quality fine; no parks on quality grounds"** — honored; only MU parked, and
  for *event* risk, not signal quality. GOOG/UNH/JPM (06-23's flat 0/3) were a news-quiet tape.
- **IMP-005/007 EOD flatten validated live 06-23** — exit infra now trustworthy; no watchlist action.

### Watchlist review
Account ACTIVE, equity **$9,314.69** (=last_equity), all cash, **0 open positions = nothing
locked.** 23 enabled reviewed vs 14d closed-trade P&L from dbo.trades:
- **Leaders:** INTC +$206.5 (5 tr, 3W), MU +$152 (6 tr, 4W), QQQ +$51 (3/3), AMD +$39, JPM +$26,
  QCOM +$25 — the semi/index regime the list is built around; chips bounce pre-market today.
- **Laggards:** AVGO −$69 (2/3), NVDA −$54 (**0/3, still never won**), BABA −$36, GOOG −$29,
  AAPL −$21, TSM −$13. Per the daily reviews every one is **regime (Iran selloff / FOMC fade /
  overnight-carry), not signal quality**; all mega-liquid. The list is semi-heavy into a volatile
  semi tape, but the long-only 5m gate simply won't fire longs in a downtrend (fewer entries, not
  bad ones) — **no signal-quality park**, KEEP on notice. Parking the most-liquid semis as they
  bounce off a one-day rout is the poor timing prior runs warned of.
- Lower-liquidity names (SE +$2.25, ABNB +$0.38, BABA) traded fine recently → keep.
- **Only MU reports earnings today** of all watchlist names → the single event-risk park.

### Changes applied to dbo.watchlist
- **PARK MU** (enabled=0, note "earnings after close today (~17% implied move), no overnight
  binary hold"). MU is not held → parkable; this is the pre-flagged required action.
- **No other changes.** A volatile, semi-rout-rebound tape on a binary-event day is the wrong
  time to churn or chase a momentum add; every laggard is regime/carry per the dailies, none a
  liquidity/signal park. XOM/WPM/ENPH/BIRD stay parked. **Re-enable MU on the 06-25 routine**
  once the print is digested (it's a top-2 earner — park is event-driven, not a demotion).

### Final watchlist
**22 enabled** (MU parked): AAPL ABNB AMD AMZN AVGO BABA C COST GOOG INTC JPM MSFT NFLX NVDA
QCOM QQQ SE SPY TSLA TSM UNH WMT. Service **restarted: yes** — active, clean startup 11:32 UTC,

## 2026-06-23 — Pre-market Research

**First clean-and-flat morning in 12 sessions** — broker holds 0 positions, equity all cash.
Nothing locked; full watchlist free to trade. IMP-007 (wall-clock EOD-flatten watchdog) gets
its first live test at *tonight's* close — an exit-infra/ops matter, not a watchlist action.

### Market context
- **Light, news-quiet Tuesday.** No major economic releases and **no watchlist name reports
  today.** FedEx (FDX) reports **late Tue** and Micron (**MU**) **late Wed 06-24** — both
  after-close, neither today. **May PCE Thu 06-25** is the week's macro binary.
- **Hawkish-Fed overhang persists.** After 06-17's hawkish hold, short-end yields kept climbing;
  CME FedWatch now prices **~70% odds of a rate *hike* by September**. Last week S&P **+0.93%**,
  Nasdaq **+2.4%**, led by chips on the INTC–Apple chip-design theme.
- **Chips firm again pre-market** (Nasdaq tailwind) — directly supports our semi/AI-heavy roster.
  Oil **<$77** (Iran–US peace-talk progress) → energy still the laggard, **XOM stays parked**.
  **GOOGL −2% pre** on a report a DeepMind scientist is leaving for Anthropic — a mild,
  non-binary talent-headline, not an earnings/halt event.

### Carried from daily review
06-22 daily-review "Notes for pre-market research" acted on:
- **Book CLEAN & FLAT** (0 broker positions, 0 DB-open rows, equity $9,321.12) — **nothing
  locked**, no carried lots, no phantoms. No park/keep constraints inherited.
- **⚠️ MU earnings late Wed 06-24** — MU is a watchlist name (no longer a held lot). Reports
  **after Wednesday's close**, so **today (Tue) carries zero MU earnings risk → KEEP MU today.**
  The **Wed 06-24 pre-market routine MUST park MU** before Wed's open so the bot can't be holding
  it into the after-close print (the recurring flatten-reliability risk makes carrying a
  binary-event name overnight unacceptable). Flagged, not actioned today.
- **"Entry/symbol quality unchanged; no parks indicated on quality grounds"** — honored.
- **06-23 is IMP-005/007's first live flatten test** — ops/daily-review matter, no watchlist action.

### Watchlist review
Account ACTIVE, equity **$9,321.12** (= last_equity), all cash, **0 open positions = nothing
locked.** 23 enabled reviewed vs 14d closed-trade P&L from dbo.trades:
- **Leaders:** INTC +$206.5 (5 tr, 3W), MU +$152 (6 tr, 4W), QQQ +$51 (3/3), JPM +$28, QCOM +$25,
  UNH +$9, SPY +$6 — core keeps; the semi/index regime the list is built around is working and
  chips are firm again pre-market.
- **Laggards:** AVGO −$69 (2/3 — winning recently), NVDA −$54 (**0/3, still never won**), TSLA −$38,
  BABA −$36, GOOG −$25, AAPL −$21. Per the daily reviews every one is **regime (Iran selloff /
  FOMC fade) or overnight-carry, not signal quality**; all mega-liquid. Parking the most-liquid
  semis (NVDA/AVGO) as chips rip is the poor timing prior runs warned of → **KEEP, on notice**.
  GOOG's −2% pre on the DeepMind headline is minor and the long-only gate simply won't trigger
  longs in a downtrend — no park.
- Lower-liquidity names (SE +$4.7, ABNB +$0.4, BABA) traded fine recently → keep.
- No earnings on any watchlist name today; MU (Wed) + PCE (Thu) are the only binary flags ahead.

### Changes applied to dbo.watchlist
**No changes.** Nothing locked, but the list is broad (23 ≤ 30) and semi/index-heavy into a
confirmed-working, chip-led tape; **zero earnings risk today** (MU is Wed, after-close); every
laggard is regime/carry per the dailies, none a signal-quality or liquidity park; and a hawkish-Fed,
news-quiet day is the wrong tape to chase a momentum add. XOM/WPM/ENPH/BIRD stay parked (energy
still the laggard on <$77 oil). MU park is **tomorrow's** task, not today's.

### Final watchlist
23 enabled (unchanged): AAPL ABNB AMD AMZN AVGO BABA C COST GOOG INTC JPM MSFT MU NFLX NVDA QCOM

## 2026-06-25 — Pre-market Research

### Market context
- **Risk-on, chip-led.** Futures up on **Micron's blowout** Q3 print: S&P 500 +0.8%, Nasdaq 100 **+2.2%**,
  Dow +0.3%. MU revived the AI trade and is dragging the whole semi complex higher.
- **MU Q3 (after close 06-24):** rev **$41.46B** (+346% YoY) vs $35.84B est, adj EPS **$25.11** vs ~$20.2 est,
  gross margin **84.9%**, Q4 guide **~$50B** vs $43.58B est, plus 16 take-or-pay long-term contracts
  (~$100B floor, $22B deposits). Stock **+15% after-hours** (~$1,201 last vs $1,047.92 reg-session close;
  ~+17% in pre-market). QCOM **+11.7%** on its own raised FY29 non-handset guidance. Sympathy bids across
  WDC/Sandisk/Lam/KLA/AMAT — our AMD/NVDA/AVGO/TSM/INTC all carry the tailwind.
- **⚠️ May PCE at 8:30 ET (12:30 UTC)** — Fed's preferred gauge and the day's macro binary. Consensus
  hotter than April (headline +0.5% m/m / +4.1% y/y; **core +0.3% m/m / +3.4% y/y**). Fed turned hawkish
  last week → a hot print could cap the AI rally. Tug-of-war: AI optimism vs sticky inflation. **Late-day
  entries into the print are extra risky** (carried straight from the 06-24 daily review).
- 10y yield 4.412% (+1bp). Oil still soft (Hormuz tankers exiting on the ceasefire) — energy stays the
  laggard, XOM stays parked.

### Carried from daily review (06-24)
- **RE-ENABLE MU** once the after-hours move is digested, after checking the post-print gap → **done.**
  The gap is a clean **+15% UP** on a blowout beat (not a chart-breaking gap down), MU is a top-2 earner
  (+$152 / 14d), very liquid (~$1.1B daily $-vol), and trends intraday. The park was event-driven, not a
  demotion → re-enabled. Asset re-verified on Alpaca: `tradable=true, status=active`.
- Book was **clean & flat** into 06-25 (0 positions, 0 DB-open rows, equity all cash) — confirmed.
- Daily review: symbol quality is otherwise fine; the weak-crossover underperformance is a code/scoring
  question for the daily-review routine, **not a watchlist change**. No quality parks today.

### Watchlist review
- Account ACTIVE, equity **$9,299.11**, **0 open positions** → nothing locked.
- 22 enabled names reviewed against the chip-led risk-on tape + 14d trade P&L. Semis (AMD/NVDA/AVGO/TSM/
  INTC/QCOM) all ride the MU/QCOM rally — keep. INTC (+$176/14d) and MU (+$152) remain the two best earners;
  QQQ (+$51, 3/3) and the mega-caps fit the trending tape. ABNB/SE/TSLA/JPM/AMD net positive. C and NFLX
  never signaled in 14d but are liquid large-caps — leave enabled, not park candidates yet.
- **No adds.** The list already holds 6–7 semis; piling more single-catalyst chip names (WDC/LRCX/KLAC/AMAT)
  the morning of a possibly-hot PCE would be concentration-chasing, and the daily review requested no adds.
  Conservative = correct.

### Changes applied to dbo.watchlist
- **Re-enabled MU** (`enabled=1`, note "re-enabled 2026-06-25: blowout Q3 earnings digested (+15% AH),
  top-2 earner, liquid"). Only change.
- Still parked (unchanged): BIRD (micro-cap), ENPH (10.9% ATR whipsaw), WPM (downtrend/dead-vol), XOM
  (broken oil downtrend).

### Final watchlist
**23 enabled** (≤30 ✓): AAPL ABNB AMD AMZN AVGO BABA C COST GOOG INTC JPM MSFT **MU** NFLX NVDA QCOM QQQ

## 2026-06-26 — Pre-market Research

### Market context
- **Risk-OFF, tech/semis selling off.** Futures lower on a **global tech sell-off** — investors worried
  about mounting **AI data-center / memory-infrastructure costs** and that AI valuations have run ahead of
  fundamentals. Asian tech sold off sharply overnight; Mag7 complex (MAGS ETF ~$60.95, −0.18% pre) under
  pressure again.
- **Thursday 06-25 close was mixed/lower** despite MU's blowout — S&P 500 and Nasdaq finished lower.
  **AAPL and MSFT fell** after both announced **price increases on consumer hardware** (rising memory
  costs) — a direct, but non-binary, headwind on those two names.
- **No watchlist-name earnings today.** MU already reported (Wed 06-24, after close); the week's macro
  binary (**May PCE**) printed **yesterday 06-25**. Today's follow-through is a **tech-led risk-off** drift,
  not an event day. NKE reports around now but is not on our list.
- 06-25's hotter-PCE/AI-cost overhang is now playing through as a tech fade. Energy still the laggard
  (oil soft) → XOM stays parked.

### Carried from daily review (06-25)
- **Book CLEAN & FLAT into 06-26** — 0 broker positions, 0 DB-open rows, equity **$9,246.50** all cash.
  **Nothing locked**; full watchlist free of carry/park constraints. Confirmed live this run.
- **MU re-enable validated** (trailing stop locked +2.48% on 06-25) → **KEEP MU**, event-park fully unwound.
- **AMD open-spike loss** (highest-ever conf 91.73 bought the MU-euphoria gap-up and stopped −1.64%) was a
  **regime/timing** loss, **not symbol quality** → KEEP AMD, no park. Today's tech-down tape is the mirror
  case: the long-only ribbon simply won't fire longs in a downtrend, so it self-protects on a sell-off day.
- **JPM (weak xo) / C (scratch)** were choppy-tape outcomes, not symbol failures → no quality parks.

### Watchlist review
- Account **ACTIVE**, equity **$9,246.50**, **0 open positions → nothing locked.** 23 enabled / 4 parked
  (BIRD, ENPH, WPM, XOM). 27 rows total, 23 ≤ 30 ✓.
- 14d closed-trade P&L: **Leaders** INTC **+$114.38** (4 tr, 2W), MU **+$98.19** (5/3), SE +$35.65 (2/2),
  UNH +$16.12, ABNB +$13.26, AVGO/QQQ/WMT small green. **Laggards** AMD −$53.94 (2/0, the 06-25 open-spike
  loss), BABA −$38.26, GOOG −$29.06, AAPL −$28.32, AMZN −$18.60, TSM −$13.95, SPY/JPM/NVDA mid-single-neg.
  Every laggard is **regime/timing or overnight-carry** per the dailies — all mega-liquid large-caps, none a
  signal-quality or liquidity park. The core semi/index roster (INTC, MU, the two best earners) is exactly
  the regime the list is built around.
- **AAPL / MSFT carry today's only name-specific headline** (hardware price hikes on memory costs) — a
  mild, non-binary negative, not an earnings/halt/binary event. The long-only gate won't chase them lower;
  no park warranted (one-day macro/tech-cost headline, not a broken-symbol thesis).
- **No adds.** Adding momentum/semi names into a **tech-led sell-off** would be chasing into weakness and
  pure concentration-stacking — the wrong tape. The daily review requested no adds; conservative = correct.

### Changes applied to dbo.watchlist
- **No changes.** Book is flat (nothing locked), zero watchlist-name earnings today, all 23 enabled names
  are liquid large-caps whose recent weakness is regime/timing (not quality), and a risk-off tech sell-off
  is the wrong day to add momentum. The long-only ribbon self-protects by not firing longs in downtrends.
  BIRD/ENPH/WPM/XOM stay parked (unchanged).

### Final watchlist
**23 enabled** (≤30 ✓, unchanged): AAPL ABNB AMD AMZN AVGO BABA C COST GOOG INTC JPM MSFT MU NFLX NVDA

## 2026-06-29 — Pre-market Research

**First session after a flat, profitable Friday.** Book CLEAN & FLAT (0 positions, equity all cash);
nothing locked → full watchlist free. IMP-011 (`MIN_CROSSOVER` 0.20 floor) is live from the 06-26
restart and gets its **first full live trading week** — the weekly review's focus is to prove it
(entry count holds, weak-cross cohort filtered, win rate rises). That is a results/ops grade, not a
watchlist action.

### Market context
- **Bifurcated tape: index futures up, chips down again.** S&P futures +~1.1%, Nasdaq-100 +~1.3%,
  Dow +0.6%, Russell −0.2% — but the **semiconductor rotation that ran all last week continues**:
  **MU −6%+** and SanDisk (SNDK) −6%+ pre-market on multi-billion notionals; AI valuation / memory-cost
  overhang persists and Apple's hardware price hikes are pressuring Asian tech (KOSPI hit trading curbs).
  Speculative money is rotating into micro-caps (ILLR +65%, IVF +48%, SHPH +41%) — outside our liquid
  large-cap universe, not add candidates.
- **Quiet earnings week.** No major tech reports until late July (AAPL 07-30, META 07-29). **No watchlist
  name reports this week** — NKE (athleisure, not ours) is the only notable. **Zero watchlist earnings
  risk.** Busy macro week ahead (data + Fed speakers) but no binary today.
- Energy still the laggard → **XOM stays parked**.

### Carried from daily review (06-26)
- **Book CLEAN & FLAT into today** — 0 broker positions, 0 DB-open rows, equity **$9,308.54** all cash
  (== last_equity; confirmed live this run). Nothing locked; full watchlist free.
- **No quality parks indicated.** The 06-26 weak-cross losers (COST/AMZN/SPY/QQQ/ABNB, all xo<0.20) are
  **NOT** watchlist parks — they're liquid large-caps and the issue was *signal strength on the day*, now
  filtered in code by **IMP-011**. Strong-cross **MSFT (+$74.72) / NFLX** traded beautifully → keep.
- **AMD open-spike** (06-25, conf 91.73 −$53.94) is a regime/timing loss, not symbol quality → keep AMD.
- **IMP-011 live** — expect fewer entries; watch count doesn't collapse + surviving win rate rises.

### Watchlist review
Account ACTIVE, equity **$9,308.54**, **0 open positions = nothing locked.** 23 enabled / 4 parked
(BIRD, ENPH, WPM, XOM); 23 ≤ 30 ✓. Reviewed vs 12d closed-trade P&L from dbo.trades:
- **Leaders:** INTC **+$114.38** (4 tr, 2W), MSFT **+$74.72** (1/1), SE +$35.65 (2/2), UNH +$23.92,
  MU +$22.26 (3/2) — the semi/index regime the list is built around; all keeps.
- **Laggards:** AMD −$53.94 (06-25 open-spike), BABA −$43.60 (overnight-carry), JPM −$42.41, GOOG −$35.40,
  AMZN −$30.47, AAPL −$20.91, SPY −$17.47. Per the daily reviews every one is **regime / timing /
  overnight-carry / weak-cross (now filtered by IMP-011) — not signal quality**; all mega-liquid large-caps,
  none a liquidity or quality park → KEEP, on notice.
- **AVGO, WMT** enabled but **no trades in 12d** — liquid large-caps the gate simply hasn't triggered;
  consistent with keeping inactive-but-liquid names (C/NFLX) prior runs → no park-for-inactivity.
- **MU −6% pre** is the **chip-rotation selloff, not an event** (MU already reported 06-24). The long-only
  5m gate won't fire longs in a downtrend (fewer entries, not bad ones) — MU is a top earner, self-protects
  → **KEEP** (regime, not symbol). ENPH/WPM `n=1` in the query are IMP-006 phantom-sweep rows (pnl=0), not
  real trades.

### Changes applied to dbo.watchlist
**No changes.** Nothing locked, but the list is broad (23 ≤ 30) and semi/index-heavy; **zero watchlist
earnings risk this week**; every laggard is regime/timing/carry/weak-cross per the dailies, none a
signal-quality or liquidity park; and a **bifurcated chip-rotation/risk-off-in-semis tape** is the wrong
day to chase a momentum add (today's gainers are speculative micro-caps outside our universe). IMP-011's
first full live week is the time to *let it prove out*, not churn the list. BIRD/ENPH/WPM/XOM stay parked.

## 2026-06-30 — Pre-market Research

**Quarter-end day** (final session of Q2). Book CLEAN & FLAT (0 positions, equity all cash); nothing
locked → full watchlist free. IMP-011 (`MIN_CROSSOVER` 0.20 floor) continues its first full live week —
the weekly review's directive is to *let it prove out without stacking another entry-logic change*; that
is a results/ops grade, not a watchlist action.

### Market context
- **Risk-on, megacap-tech rebound into quarter-end.** Mon 06-29 ripped: Dow **record close 52,182.74**
  (+0.59%), S&P **+1.18%** (7,440.43), Nasdaq Composite **+2.07%** (Nasdaq-100 +2.3%) on a Mag7 rebound
  after a soft prior week. **GOOG/Alphabet +4.96%** (first day as a Dow component, replacing Verizon),
  **TSLA +8.45%**, AMZN +3.18%, META +2.2%, NVDA +1.3%. This morning futures hold the gains (Dow +~0.1%,
  S&P modestly higher). Some of the late-June tech wobble is attributed to **quarter-end rebalancing** by
  pensions/SWFs — a positioning distortion, not a fundamental signal.
- **No watchlist name reports today** (or this week). Today's only notable earnings is **NKE after close**
  (not ours); nothing before the bell. **Zero watchlist earnings/binary risk.** Next major tech reports
  late July (META 07-29, AAPL 07-30).
- **Macro:** holiday-shortened week — the big catalyst is **Thursday's June jobs report**; today is light.
  Bond market closed Fri 07-03 (Independence Day). S&P closed Friday just below its 50-day MA (now ~7,363)
  for the first time since early April — a level to watch, but Monday's rally lifted back above.
- **Oil firmer** (Brent $73.15 +1.6%, WTI $70.75 +2.2%) as traders watch whether the Iran pause holds —
  a **one-headline geopolitical bid, not a durable energy uptrend** → **XOM stays parked** (same discipline
  as every prior run; no knife-catch long).

### Carried from daily review (06-29)
- **Book CLEAN & FLAT into 06-30** — 0 broker positions, 0 DB-open rows, equity **$9,398.23** all cash
  (== last_equity; confirmed live this run). Nothing locked; full watchlist free.
- **No watchlist-name earnings this week → zero binary event risk.** Confirmed via today's calendar.
- **Chip-rotation pre-market scares are noise intraday** — on 06-29 MU (+1.28%), AMD (+1.38%), TSM (+3.12%)
  all traded green via the long-only gate. **No semis park indicated** — the regime call holds, keep the
  semi roster.
- **C and SPY are persistent weak-cross chop names** (rejected ×4 / ×2 on 06-29, xo<0.20) — these are **NOT**
  watchlist parks (liquid large-caps; IMP-011 filters their weak crosses in code). No quality park.
- **MSFT** was 06-29's biggest loser despite the strongest cross (high-conf *early* entry) — a *code/timing*
  watch item (the emerging open-spike pattern), **not** a symbol-quality issue → **keep MSFT**.

### Watchlist review
Account ACTIVE, equity **$9,398.23**, BP $37,592.92, **0 open positions = nothing locked.** 23 enabled /
4 parked (BIRD, ENPH, WPM, XOM); 27 rows, 23 ≤ 30 ✓.
- The roster is megacap/semi/index-heavy — **exactly the cohort leading today's risk-on, quarter-end
  rebound** (GOOG/TSLA/AMZN/MSFT/NVDA/QQQ/SPY). No name carries a negative catalyst, earnings, or halt risk
  today; every laggard from the dailies is **regime / timing / overnight-carry / weak-cross (now filtered by
  IMP-011) — not signal quality**, and all are mega-liquid large-caps → KEEP, on notice.
- **AVGO, WMT** still no trades recently — liquid large-caps the gate simply hasn't triggered; consistent
  with keeping inactive-but-liquid names (C/NFLX) → no park-for-inactivity.
- **XOM (parked):** today's oil pop is a geopolitical headline bid, not a trend → stays parked.
- **SPCX** fast-tracked into the Nasdaq-100 (joins ~07-07) — noted as a future candidate once it has trading
  history; still too new for the ribbon. Today's speculative gainers were micro-caps outside our universe.

### Changes applied to dbo.watchlist
**No changes.** Nothing locked, the list is broad (23 ≤ 30) and megacap/semi/index-heavy into a risk-on,
megacap-led tape; **zero watchlist earnings/binary risk today**; every laggard is regime/timing/carry/
weak-cross per the dailies, none a signal-quality or liquidity park. A **quarter-end-rebalancing-distorted
pop** is the wrong day to chase a momentum add, and IMP-011's first full live week should be left to prove
out, not churned. BIRD/ENPH/WPM/XOM stay parked (unchanged).

### Final watchlist
**23 enabled** (≤30 ✓, unchanged): AAPL ABNB AMD AMZN AVGO BABA C COST GOOG INTC JPM MSFT MU NFLX NVDA
QCOM QQQ SE SPY TSLA TSM UNH WMT. Service **NOT restarted** (no watchlist change → the bot reads the list
only at startup, so a restart would be pointless churn). 🔒 Locked: none (0 open positions).
