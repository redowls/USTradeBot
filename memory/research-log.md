# Research Log

Pre-market watchlist research journal for USTradeBot. **One dated entry per day**,
written by the `ustradebot-premarket` routine (11:30 UTC, Mon–Fri) after reviewing
news + technical charts for every watchlist symbol and applying changes to
`dbo.watchlist` in the USBot database.

Hard rules the routine must never break:
- NEVER park/remove a symbol that has an open position in the Alpaca account.
- Max **30 enabled** symbols.
- Every added symbol must be verified tradable & active on Alpaca (`/v2/assets/{SYM}`).
- Park with `enabled = 0` (keep the row) instead of DELETE.

Entry template:

## 2026-06-13 — Pre-market Research

First run of this routine. Note: today is Saturday; next session is **Monday 2026-06-15**
(this entry prepares Monday's open).

### Market context
- Volatile Iran-headline week: big drops Jun 9–10 on strike fears, +1.75–3% rally Jun 11
  on de-escalation hopes, mixed/choppy Friday Jun 12 (S&P flat, Dow +0.6%, Nasdaq −0.3%).
- SpaceX (SPCX) IPO debuted Fri +19% to $160.95 — largest IPO ever ($75B), now ~$2.1T cap.
  Watching as a future candidate once it has trading history; too new for the ribbon now.
- Week ahead: light earnings (ACN/KR Thu, KMX Wed — none on our list). Macro-heavy:
  industrial production Mon, **FOMC decision Wed Jun 17**, retail sales Wed,
  **market closed Fri Jun 19 (Juneteenth)**. Oil fell Friday on peace-deal prospect —
  energy momentum fading.

### Carried from daily review
None — memory/daily-review.md is template-only (routines went live today).

### Watchlist review
Account: ACTIVE, equity $9,416.79, **no open positions** (no locked symbols).
26 enabled symbols reviewed against 60-day Alpaca bars (trend vs 20/50MA, 15d ATR%,
20d avg dollar volume) + 14d closed-trade P&L from dbo.trades:
- Clean uptrends, liquid: AMD (+6/+32 vs 20/50MA), INTC (+10/+30), MU (+10/+45, best
  P&L +$83), C, JPM, UNH, TSM — core keeps.
- Broad market dip names (AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, MSFT, NVDA, QQQ, SPY, TSLA, etc.): below
  20MA from the Iran selloff but mega-liquid; kept — regime, not symbol, problem.
- **WPM**: lowest dollar volume on list (~$237M/day), −6%/−12% vs 20/50MA, zero
  signals in 14d → PARK.
- **ENPH**: 10.9% ATR (extreme whipsaw, −9% vs 20MA yet +22% vs 50MA), zero trades
  in 14d; unsuited to a ribbon-trend strategy → PARK.
- Watch (kept, on notice): NVDA 0/3 trades −$54 in 14d; AVGO −$74 (1/2) and −9% vs
  20MA with 6.5% ATR; SE third-lowest liquidity ($321M) in a downtrend.
- No watchlist name reports earnings next week; no binary events besides FOMC Wed.

### Changes applied to dbo.watchlist
- PARK WPM (enabled=0): downtrend, lowest $vol, no signals 14d.
- PARK ENPH (enabled=0): 10.9% ATR whipsaw, too choppy for ribbon, no trades.
- No adds — FOMC week, list already broad; no high-conviction candidate (SPCX too new).

### Final watchlist
24 enabled: AAPL ABNB AMD AMZN AVGO BABA C COST GOOG INTC JPM MSFT MU NFLX NVDA
QCOM QQQ SE SPY TSLA TSM UNH WMT XOM. Service restarted: yes — active, clean startup,
24-symbol subscribe confirmed in journal. (Side note for daily review: pre-restart log
shows a Jun 12 20:57 APIError "order is not open" during an exit — worth a look.)
